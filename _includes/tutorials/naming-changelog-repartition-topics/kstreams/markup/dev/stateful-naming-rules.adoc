Here's a quick reference guide to stateful naming rules


- Aggregation repartition topics
   . Use the `Grouped.as()` method
   . Use `Grouped` to provide repartition `Serdes` as well if required
   . Kafka Streams appends the text `-repartition` to the provided name
   . If no name is provided, the state store name is used with `-repartition` appended

- Joins

- State Stores
   . Use `Materialized.as()` method
   . Use `Materialized` for state store `Serdes` if needed
   . If no name provided, Kafka Streams generates the name
