Now let's add a new operator (`filter()`) to the named topology:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="java">
  KStream&lt;Long, Example&gt; inputStream = builder.stream(inputTopic, Consumed.with(longSerde, exampleSerde))
                                                  .selectKey((k, v) -> Long.parseLong(v.getName().substring(0, 1)))
                                                  .filter((k, v) -> k != 1L);
</code></pre>
+++++

But this time, adding a new processor won't change the name of the stateful parts of your application, as you've explicity named them in the previous step.

Now go back to the window running the streams application and do a `CTRL+C` then restart the streams application with this command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/render-run-dev-app-names-with-filter.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++
