Now let's start over but this time you'll update the topology and provide names to all stateful operators:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="java">
 countStream = inputStream.groupByKey(Grouped.with("count", longSerde, stringSerde))
                                   .count(Materialized.as("the-counting-store"))
                                   .toStream();

 joinedStream = inputStream.join(countStream, (v1, v2) -> v1 + v2.toString(),
                                 JoinWindows.of(Duration.ofMillis(100)),
                                 StreamJoined.with(longSerde, stringSerde, longSerde)
                                             .withName("join").withStoreName("the-join-store"));
</code></pre>

Just like you've done throughout the tutorial, the changes are made by using feature flags which are enabled by parameters you pass to start the application.

Now go back to the window running the streams application and do a `CTRL+C` then restart the streams application with this command:
