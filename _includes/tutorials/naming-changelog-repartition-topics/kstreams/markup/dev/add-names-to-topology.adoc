Now let's update the topology by adding a `filter()` operation:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="java">
  KStream&lt;Long, Example&gt; inputStream = builder.stream(inputTopic, Consumed.with(longSerde, exampleSerde))
                                                  .selectKey((k, v) -> Long.parseLong(v.getName().substring(0, 1)))
                                                  .filter((k, v) -> k != 1L);
</code></pre>
+++++

But this time, adding a new processor won't change the name of the stateful parts of your application, as you've explicity named them.

Just like you've done throughout the tutorial, the changes are made by using feature flags. Update the `configuration/dev.properties` file to enable the addition of a the additional processor.

Now restart the streams application:
