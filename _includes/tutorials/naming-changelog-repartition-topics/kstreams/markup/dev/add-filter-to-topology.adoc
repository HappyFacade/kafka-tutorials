As you may have guessed, adding or subtracting a processor in your topology will change the name of all processors downstram of your change.

With that in mind, let's add a `filter()` processor to the `inputStream`:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="java">
  KStream&lt;Long, Example&gt; inputStream = builder.stream(inputTopic, Consumed.with(longSerde, exampleSerde))
                                                  .selectKey((k, v) -> Long.parseLong(v.getName().substring(0, 1)))
                                                  .filter((k, v) -> k != 1L);
</code></pre>
+++++

To make things a little easier for you, the code for the tutorial is configured to use feature flags. Make the following changes to the `dev.properties` file:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/configuration/no-names-with-filter.properties %}</code></pre>
+++++

Since you've added the `filter()` before the aggregation, the name of the state store, changelog topic, and repartition topic will change.

In the new names, the number suffix will go from `0000000002` to `0000000003` like so:


* state store - `<application.id>-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003`
* changelog topic - `<application.id>-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-changelog`
* repartition topic - `<application.id>-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-repartition`

Now restart the streams application with the following command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/run-dev-app.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++
