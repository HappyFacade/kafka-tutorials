. Always name sateful operators
. If you haven't named your stateful operators and you need to update your toplogy, use the `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/app-reset-tool.html[Application Reset Tool]` to reprocess records (tutorial coming soon!).


- **Aggregation repartition topics (if needed)**
   . Use the `Grouped.as()` method
   . Use `Grouped` to provide repartition `Serdes` as well if required
   . Kafka Streams appends the text `-repartition` to the provided name
   . If no name is provided, the state store name is used with `-repartition` appended

- **Joins**
   . Use the `StreamJoined` configuration object
   . `StreamJoined.name()` names the join processors and provides the base-name of the repartition topic (if needed)
   . `StreamJoined.withStoreName()` used to name the state stores associated with the join.
   . If you need to provide `Serdes` you'll use `StreamJoined` as well

- **State Stores**
   . Use `Materialized.as()` method
   . Use `Materialized` for state store `Serdes` if needed
