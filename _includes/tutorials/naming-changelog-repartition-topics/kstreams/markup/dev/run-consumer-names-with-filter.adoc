  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Now stop the console-prodcer (if you haven't already) and start a console-consumer (for the last time I promise!)


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-names-with-filter.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Looking at the last three records you see `2-4, 2-5, 2-6`.  This output is correct as you produced six records with the same key, so the final count is accurate.

You have updated your topology and re-used the existing state stores and internal topics!
